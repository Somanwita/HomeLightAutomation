# HomeLightAutomation
Many of us live in apartments which have no or limited source of natural light which often causes sleeplessness and uneasiness while waking up. Additionally, leaving the lights on happens often enough in my household which is annoying and wasteful. Very often I am late to work\school as I forget to set up the alarm or adjust the time after a lazy weekend. The application which I would be building will allow me to sync wake up and sleeping routine with nature as season changes. It will mimic a sunrise and wake me up with a gradually increasing amount of light and dim them gradually as I prepare for bed. It will help me having more control on home lighting systems and provide convenient ways to control and monitor. It will also help to curb unnecessary wastage of electricity and save monthly utilities expenditure.
