# HomeLightAutomation
Many of us live in apartments which have no or limited source of natural light which often causes sleeplessness and uneasiness while waking up. Additionally, leaving the lights on happens often enough in my household which is annoying and wasteful.The application which I built allows me to sync wake up and sleeping routine with nature as season changes. It  mimics a sunrise and wake me up with a gradually increasing amount of light and dim them gradually as I prepare for bed. It helps me having more control on home lighting systems and provide convenient ways to control and monitor. Additionally, it curbs unnecessary wastage of electricity and save monthly utilities expenditure.
